# Fastnet Radius Dashboard (starter)

This is a starter React + Vite + Tailwind project scaffold for the Fastnet Radius Dashboard. It includes basic layout, Dashboard and Users pages with mock data, Recharts, and a small component library.

Quick start:

```bash
# install
npm install

# dev
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and other UI libs are referenced in package.json; you may want to replace placeholders with the official shadcn components.
- This is a minimal, modular starting point. Next steps: implement full pages (Packages, Transactions, SMS, Routers, Settings, Support), add Zustand store, and wire a mock API (JSON Server) for endpoints.
